# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship-Tasks

Data Science & Business Analytics Internship
This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from The Sparks Company Internship. I will be updating the tasks I perform as a Data Science and Business Analytics intern at a singapore based company: The Sparks Limited.

Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML
Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually. I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.

Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
Perform Ã¢â‚¬ËœExploratory Data AnalysisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on dataset Ã¢â‚¬ËœSampleSuperstoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ I will be doing this with the help of python libraries i.e. matplotlib and seaborn. As a Business Analytics intern, I tried to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit. Also, tried to find out business problems can be derived by exploring the data.
